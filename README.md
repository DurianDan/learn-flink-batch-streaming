 learn flink from docs

# Overview
- Problems to solve:
    - how to implement streaming data processing pipelines
    - how and why Flink manages state 
    - how to use event time to consistently compute accurate analytics
    - how to build event-driven applications on continuous streams
    - how Flink is able to provide fault-tolerant, stateful stream processing with exactly-once semantics
- Topics to focuse on: 
    - Continuous processing of streaming data
    - Event time
    - Stateful stream processing
    - State snapshots
